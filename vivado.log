CRITICAL WARNING: [Designutils 20-923] The following port(s) exceed allowable noise margins:
    1. B_P[0]
    2. B_P[1]
    3. B_P[2]
    4. B_P[3]
    5. B_P[4]

    13. B_P[12]
    14. B_P[13]
    15. B_P[15]

Resolution: SSN margins are pessimistic on numbers, and depending on how big the negative margin is, there are ways to improve numbers:
-In Pin Planning project: Adjust the IOStandard to one that requires a lower VCCO, (Example: LVCMOS33 to LVCMOS18), change pin location, or adjust SLEW from FAST to SLOW. 
-In RTL/Netlist project: Adjust the IOStandard, SLEW, change pin location, or run SSN with phase by running report_ssn -phase or adjust the clock phases of the design. 
Please refer to UG899 Vivado Design Suite User Guide I/O and Clock Planning for additional details. 
Refer to  "Links" for more information on improving SSN margin.

Command: report_power -name power_1
WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design! Power estimation will be inaccurate until this is corrected.
Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock for sequential elements. For pure combinatorial circuits, please specify a virtual clock, otherwise the vectorless estimation might be inaccurate
